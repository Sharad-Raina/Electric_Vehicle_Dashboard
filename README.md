## **Problem Statement**  
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the growth and distribution of electric vehicles using real-world data. It aims to answer critical questions about market penetration, technological advancements, and consumer preferences using interactive visualizations.  

## **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
The dashboard focuses on the following key metrics:  
✅ **Total Vehicles:** Understanding the total count of EVs, including **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** and **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**.  
✅ **Average Electric Range:** Analyzing the efficiency and technological improvements in EV battery range.  
✅ **BEV vs. PHEV Market Share:** Determining the proportion of fully electric vs. hybrid vehicles in the dataset.  
✅ **EV Growth Over Time:** Visualizing the increase in EV adoption from 2010 onward.  
✅ **Geographic Distribution:** Mapping EV adoption by state.  
✅ **Market Leaders:** Identifying top manufacturers and models dominating the EV market.  

## **Data Sources**  
The project is based on real-world **Electric Vehicle Population Data**, processed and visualized using **Tableau**. The dataset contains information on vehicle make, model, year, electric range, and location.  

### **Files in this Repository**  
📂 `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv` – The dataset used for analysis.  
📂 `Electric_Vehicle.twb` – Tableau workbook containing the dashboard and visualizations.  
📂 `Electric Vehicle Presentation.pptx` – Presentation summarizing the insights derived from the analysis.  

## **Visualizations**  
The dashboard includes:  
📈 **Total Vehicles by Model Year (2010 Onwards):** A line/area chart showing EV growth trends over time.  
🗺️ **Total Vehicles by State:** A geographical heatmap illustrating EV distribution.  
📊 **Top 10 EV Manufacturers:** A bar chart highlighting market leaders.  
🥧 **CAFV Eligibility Distribution:** A pie chart showing the proportion of vehicles eligible for **Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV)** incentives.  
🔲 **Top 10 EV Models:** A tree map displaying the most popular EV models.  

## **Tools & Technologies Used**  
- **Tableau** (for data visualization)  
- **Microsoft Excel** (for initial data processing)  
- **Power BI** *(Dec 2023 version, for additional insights)*
